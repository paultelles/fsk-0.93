Possible problems and pitfalls when using 'pcfs'
================================================

This document contains a number of problems and solutions found when
using standard unix utilities on pcfs.

Most of these problems come from the inherent limitations of the DOS
FAT-based filesystem, which is a bad match for UNIX.


1. Don't use the -u flag of cpio on pcfs 
   --------------------------------------

Problem: I discovered this problem while restoring a large cpio file onto
a mounted pcfs filesystem. When you use the '-u' flag the original 
directories can get unlinked and cpio cannot create new links to the
temporary file it uses internally. Fortunately cpio then fails, so it won't
destroy a whole filesystem this way.

Result: The original directory is gone and after running CHKDSK you
find a number of lost cluster chains.

Recovery: A good DOS-based unerase program should be able to unerase
the lost directory and restore the contents if you immediately unmount the
pcfs filesystem. Alternatively use CHKDSK /F to repair the DOS filesystem
as appropriate.

Note that this problem cannot be fixed other than by changing cpio because
the DOS FAT-based filesystem does NOT support links.
