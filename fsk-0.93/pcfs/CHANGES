Changes from fsk-0.9 to fsk-0.91
================================

	- Fixed major bug in handling of subdirectories with more

	  filesystem.

	- ANSI prototypes for all functions

	- Massive cleanup of the source code

	- Major cleanup of lint errors/warnings	

	- 'pcfs' can now be exported using NFS.

	- Made chown/chgrp into a NO-OP to fix large number
	  numbers of warnings/errors when using cpio or tar.
	  'pcfs' does not store uid's and gid's anyway.

	- Now also installs correctly when BSD Compatibility Package
	  has not been installed (whoami not needed).

	- Now installs 'mount_pcfs' manpage using 'make install.man'

	- Added a dummy 'pcfs_mountroot' function to make DELL kernels
	  happy that try to mount all available filesystems as root
	  in sequence during boot. The joys of incompatible bugfixes...

	- Fixes and enhancements in the 'mount' command.

	- Fixed the spurious warning when mounting 360K floppy
	  filesystems.
