What the CD-ROM iso9660 filesystem can do
-----------------------------------------

The iso9660 filesystem can mount the following types of CD-ROM's:

- plain iso9660 format 

- iso9660 format with RockRidge extensions

- High Sierra format


The iso9660 filesystem automatically takes advantage of RockRidge
and High Sierra format long filenames when possible.

CD-ROM's mounted with iso9660 filesystem can now be
exported using NFS, so you can use it to share CD-ROM's on
a network.


CD-ROM iso9660 filesystem quirks file
-------------------------------------

Special files like device files, sockets and symbolic links are
not supported on the CDROM.
Only CD-ROMs with RockRidge extensions normally have these features.

It is very well possible (and infinitely more useful) to have symbolic
links on your hard disk pointing to files on CD-ROM.

Take a close look at the 'lndir' command provided with MIT X11R5,
this comes in very useful for symbolically linking whole CD-ROM
directories to your hard disk, thus making it possible to
compile directly from CD-ROM while saving a large amount of space.

The 'mmap' function is yet supported on this iso9660 filesystem
so it is possible to directly execute programs from CD-ROM. Using
the new mechanism of mapping, CD-ROM accesses improved over 35 percent.


Operational Details for System V Release 4
------------------------------------------

These are just 'fill in the blanks' type of
examples to get you started (please consult
released manual pages).

To mount an iso9960 filesystem:
	mount -F iso9660 /dev/cdrom/cd1 /mnt

To unmount an iso9660 filesystem:
	umount /mnt

To share an iso9660 filesystem using NFS:

    on network node1:

    init 3  (make sure your NFS deamons are running!)
    mount -F iso9660 /dev/cdrom/cd1 /mnt		(mount read-only!!!)
    share -F nfs -oro /mnt						(share read-only!!!)

    on network node2:

    mount -F nfs -r node1:/mnt /mnt		(mount read-only!!!)

    a local loopback mount on node1:    (see manpage)

    mount -F nfs -r node1:/mnt /mnt2    (/mnt2 is the read-only NFS loopback!)


Configuring iso9660 into your kernel
------------------------------------

Running the command 'make build' in this directory will
automatically build the filesystem drivers, install them
and build a new kernel.

Just do a 'shutdown -g0 -y -i6' afterwards to reboot.
Note that you must be 'root' to do this! 


CD-ROM sector size
------------------

Most Unix versions do NOT allow unaligned accesses on the silver disk.
Such accesses, which are NOT on a SECTOR boundary will yield an EACCES.
Normally you don't need to pay attention: the disk blocksize equals the
sector size (which is 2K). No problems occur if the blocksize is a
multiple of the sector size, but in case it's less ... troubles arise:
directories and files can be read without a problem but can't be mmapped
nor NFS-ed anymore (see SECTSIZE in iso9660.h).
