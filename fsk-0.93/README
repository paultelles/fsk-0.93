Filesystem Survival Kit	 Version 0.93
-------------------------------------

0. Acknowledgements
-------------------

We did not write everything from scratch. The original basis of
our pcfs came from a version written for 386BSD by Paul Popelka
(paulp@uts.amdahl.com) and since then extensively modified for SVR4.

The original basis for the iso9660 filesytem came from a version
of isofs written for 386BSD which seems to be rooted in an even
earlier version of UFS for BSD.

The lesson: 

Nobody, repeat nobody writes filesystems from scratch.

Honorable mention should go to Roe Peterson (roe@Unibase.SK.CA)
whose 'ctools' CDROM access package got us thinking of (and buying)
a CDROM drive in the first place.

A fitting quote:

'He is a giant who stands on the shoulders of others'



1. What is the 'Filesystem Survival Kit'
----------------------------------------

The 'Filesystem Survival Kit' provides the following 
filesystem drivers:

-  An ISO9660 filesystem driver with RockRidge extensions to enable you
   to mount CD-ROM disks under the UNIX System V Release 4 operating
   system for the Intel platforms.

   The ISO9660 filesystem supports:

   - plain iso9660 CDROM format

   - iso9660 CDROM format with RockRidge extensions

   - High Sierra CDROM format

   You can use NFS to share mounted CDROMs on the network as well
   as mmap the whole disk (if you have space for it).


-  A PCFS filesystem driver to enable you to mount MS-DOS(tm)
   filesystems on either floppy or hard disk under the
   UNIX System V Release 4 operating system for the Intel platforms.

   The PCFS filesystem supports:

   - standard DOS format diskettes (360K / 720K / 1.2M and 1.44M)
	 (also 2.88M if your floppy driver allows this...)

   - all types of DOS partitions on your hard disk, provided that the
     hard disk driver is able to access them as block device.
     This is possible on any Intel-based SVR4 implementation.

   You can use NFS to share mounted PCFS partitions on the network.



2. *** DISCLAIMER ***
----------------------

As always:
 
The software in the 'fsk-0.93' Filesystem Survival Kit
is provided as is.

The author(s) supply this software to be publicly redistributed
on the understanding that the author(s) are not responsible for the
correct functioning of this software in any circumstances and are
not liable for any damages caused by this software.

Starting with 'fsk-0.91' we have put in a lot of testing and we feel
that the drivers are very stable now. The pcfs part is expected to be
write safe since fsk-0.93.

Except for some minor missing features and possible performance
enhancements they should be good enough for general use. 

Since there is always one last (minor) bug it is good practice to
make a backup of things first. It is recommended to make backups of
DOS partitions first before using 'pcfs' for the first time.

To put in a lighter note:
------------------------

We have been able to fully backup and restore DOS partitions on hard
disk using the standard UNIX 'tar' command.

The iso9660 filesystem has been very stable right from the first version,
not so surprising since it is read-only.


The drivers in this kit have been developed and tested on:

	 ESIX SVR4  4.0.4 on a 486 PC.

A lot of people have reported succes with 'fsk-0.9x' on the
following systems:

	ESIX SVR4 4.0.4
    DELL SVR4 2.2
	Consensys SVR4
	Sorix (Siemens) SVR4
    USL SVR 4.0.4
	Interactive SVR4.0.3.0

Since these drivers are fairly hardware independent we expect them
to work on most 386/486 ports of System V Release 4.

We have no reports of users using a SVR4.2 version yet.
Possibly because they already have it or because the technical
guys still use SVR4.0. Who needs a graphical desktop anyway :-) :-)

We would like to hear about your experiences on DELL, Consensys,
UHC and others. 

Send bug reports, comments etc. to:

	Gerard van Dorth	gdorth@nl.oracle.com

	Paul Bauwens		paul@pphbau.atr.bso.nl

If you don't like it, you are free to do better!


************ USE THESE FILESYSTEM DRIVERS AT YOUR OWN RISK!! ***********


3. Can I install this kit? 
--------------------------

If you do not have the UNIX System V Release 4 operating system
this kit is probably NOT for you.

The filesystem drivers in this kit are very operating system
dependent and will NOT run on any other operating system.
You can use them as a basis for your own developments though!


4. Prerequisites
----------------

In order to compile the filesystem drivers you will need the standard
AT&T C compiler package. 

For the CD-ROM filesystem you must have a working CD-ROM device driver.

This can be done in most 386 SVR4 implementations by enabling the 
'sc01' device driver in the kernel, the generic SCSI CDROM driver.

After building a new kernel you should have '/dev/cdrom/cd[0-7]'
device nodes. Due to a quirk (BUG!!) in this device driver it is
possible that one or more of these nodes actually access your
hard disk, so make sure you use the correct one to access the CDROM
drive. On our system with one SCSI disk this is '/dev/cdrom/cd1'.

The CD-ROM filesystem is a read-only filesystem.

In order to be able to mount a floppy based MS-DOS filesystem
you can use the standard '/dev/dsk/f[01]t' devices.

In order to be able to mount a MS-DOS hard disk partition you must be
able to access the MS-DOS partition as a block device.

The actual device to use depends on your operating system version
and installation, but a very common device under ESIX SVR 4.0.4
is /dev/dsk/0s5 for the C: partition.
Look in your operating system documentation for details.
Also look at /etc/partitions.


5. Installation
---------------

1. Make a backup of your root filesystem and possibly your complete
   UNIX environment first!


2. You can install 'iso9660' filesystem and the 'pcfs' filesystem
   independently, they do not depend on each other.


3. Change into the selected directory with the filesystem code you
   want to install and type (as root!):

	- To just compile the driver code:

		make all

	- To compile and install the filesystem driver:

		make install

	- To compile and install the filesystem driver AND
	  immediately build a new kernel:

		make build

	- To install the manpages:

		make install.man

4. After building a new kernel do a reboot using 'shutdown -g0 -y -i6'.
   This will automatically install the new kernel.


5. Look also in the mount/umount manpages and the README files contained
   in these directories.


6. Performance configurations
-----------------------------

In order to improve performance you should increase the number of
NBUF's from the default of 100 to at least 200-300. This enables
PCFS to keep the FAT and/or directory in the buffer cache, greatly
enhancing performance.
Add an entry to /etc/conf/cf.d/stune:

NBUF	250

If you must access large amounts of files simultaneously you can
increase the number of in-core inodes for PCFS and/or ISO9660 by
adding entries to /etc/conf/cf.d/mtune:

ISO9660NINODE 200     100     400
PCFSNINODE    200     100     400

Note: you can only use 'idtune' after you have added these entries
to the 'mtune' file in the first place...

Also note that as ISO9660 is memory mapped now, you don't need to
increase the NBUF's for this filesystem anymore.
